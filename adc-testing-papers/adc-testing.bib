		  described in the {IEEE} standards 1241-2000 and 1057-1994.
		  Least squares is the "best" fitting method most of us can

		  properties are achieved when the error (the deviation of
		  the samples from the true sine wave) is random, white (the
		  error samples are all independent), with zero mean Gaussian
		  distribution. Then, the LS fit coincides with the maximum
		  likelihood estimate of the parameters. However, in sine
		  wave testing of {ADCs}, these assumptions are far from
		  being true. The quantization error is partly deterministic,
		  and the sample values are strongly interdependent. For sine
		  waves covering less than, say, 20 quantum levels, this
		  makes the sine wave fit worse than expected, and since

  abstract	= { The evaluation of spectral parameters characterizing
		  analog-to-digital converters ({ADCs}) is addressed by
		  applying a single- or dual-tone generator to the device
		  input and by properly processing its output data stream.
		  The coherent sampling condition, highly recommended by the
		  {IEEE} standards 1057 and 1241 which list the most
		  effective {{ADC}} testing procedures, is usually difficult
		  to achieve, and sometimes even unfeasible. In fact, it
		  requires a fine synchronization between the input and the
		  sampling signals frequencies and it cannot be achieved when
		  spurious tones are present in the {{ADC}} output spectrum.
		  Data windowing is usually employed to reduce the associated
		  spectral leakage phenomenon. However, {IEEE} standards do
		  not provide clear criteria for choosing the window to be
		  used for testing a given b-bit converter. Therefore, a
		  reduced measurement reproducibility can result. The
		  European draft standard Dynad suggests the employment of
		  one out of seven windows in accordance to the {{ADC}}
		  resolution. However, each proposed sequence covers only a
		  limited converter resolution range. In this paper, an
		  {{ADC}} testing procedure is described, suitable to yield
		  highly repeatable and reproducible measurements, also when
		  noncoherent sampling applies. To this aim, the use of a
		  class of windows is proposed, that uniquely applies to
		  {ADCs} with arbitrarily high resolution. Finally,
		  experimental results that validate its effectiveness are
		  presented.},
